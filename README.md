# python_file_handling
Python file handling allows you to create, read, write, and modify files using built-in functions like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`. It also supports different modes (e.g., `"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"rb"`) and includes error handling to safely manage file operations.
